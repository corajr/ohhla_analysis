Verse One: 2Pac <br/> 
       <br/> 
When I was <span class='topic4'>young</span> me and my <span class='topic4'>mama</span> had <span class='topic25'>beef</span> <br/> <span class='topic4'>
Seventeen</span> years old kicked out on the <span class='topic39'>streets</span> <br/> 
Though back at the time, I never <span class='topic4'>thought</span> I'd see her <span class='topic41'>face</span> <br/> 
Ain't a <span class='topic45'>woman</span> <span class='topic2'>alive</span> that could take my <span class='topic4'>mama's</span> <span class='topic41'>place</span> <br/> 
Suspended from <span class='topic4'>school;</span> and <span class='topic12'>scared</span> to go <span class='topic4'>home,</span> I was a <span class='topic41'>fool</span> <br/> 
with the big <span class='topic4'>boys,</span> breakin all the rules <br/> 
I <span class='topic45'>shed</span> <span class='topic4'>tears</span> with my <span class='topic23'>baby</span> <span class='topic4'>sister</span> <br/> 
Over the years we was <span class='topic12'>poorer</span> than the other little <span class='topic4'>kids</span> <br/> 
And even though we had different daddy's, the same <span class='topic4'>drama</span> <br/> 
When <span class='topic45'>things</span> went <span class='topic45'>wrong</span> we'd <span class='topic12'>blame</span> <span class='topic4'>mama</span> <br/> 
I reminice on the stress I caused, it was <span class='topic45'>hell</span> <br/> <span class='topic8'>
Huggin</span> on my <span class='topic4'>mama</span> from a jail cell <br/> 
And who'd think in elementary? <br/> 
Heeey! I see the penitentiary, one day <br/> 
And <span class='topic37'>runnin</span> from the <span class='topic39'>police,</span> that's right <br/> <span class='topic4'>
Mama</span> <span class='topic41'>catch</span> me, put a whoopin to my backside <br/> 
And even as a <span class='topic25'>crack</span> fiend, <span class='topic4'>mama</span> <br/> 
You always was a <span class='topic12'>black</span> <span class='topic4'>queen,</span> <span class='topic4'>mama</span> <br/> 
I <span class='topic4'>finally</span> <span class='topic45'>understand</span> <br/> 
for a <span class='topic45'>woman</span> it ain't <span class='topic41'>easy</span> tryin to <span class='topic4'>raise</span> a man <br/> 
You always was committed <br/> 
A poor <span class='topic45'>single</span> <span class='topic4'>mother</span> on welfare, tell me how ya did it <br/> 
There's no way I can pay you back <br/> 
But the plan is to <span class='topic45'>show</span> you that I <span class='topic4'>understand</span> <br/> 
You are appreciated <br/> 
 <br/>

 <br/> 
Verse Two: 2Pac <br/> 
 <br/> 
Now ain't nobody tell us it was fair <br/> 
No <span class='topic8'>love</span> from my <span class='topic4'>daddy</span> cause the coward <span class='topic4'>wasn't</span> there <br/> 
He <span class='topic4'>passed</span> away and I <span class='topic4'>didn't</span> cry, cause my anger <br/> <span class='topic45'>
wouldn't</span> let me <span class='topic41'>feel</span> for a stranger <br/> 
They say I'm <span class='topic45'>wrong</span> and I'm <span class='topic25'>heartless,</span> but all along <br/> 
I was <span class='topic37'>lookin</span> for a <span class='topic4'>father</span> he was gone <br/> 
I hung around with the <span class='topic39'>Thugs,</span> and even though they sold <span class='topic4'>drugs</span> <br/> 
They <span class='topic4'>showed</span> a <span class='topic4'>young</span> <span class='topic4'>brother</span> <span class='topic8'>love</span> <br/> 
I moved out and <span class='topic4'>started</span> really hangin <br/> 
I needed <span class='topic4'>money</span> of my own so I <span class='topic4'>started</span> slangin <br/> 
I ain't <span class='topic12'>guilty</span> cause, even though I <span class='topic39'>sell</span> <span class='topic25'>rocks</span> <br/> 
It <span class='topic45'>feels</span> <span class='topic4'>good</span> puttin <span class='topic6'>money</span> in your mailbox <br/> 
I <span class='topic41'>love</span> payin rent when the rent's due <br/> 
I <span class='topic45'>hope</span> ya got the <span class='topic2'>diamond</span> necklace that I sent to you <br/> 
Cause when I was low you was there for me <br/> 
And never <span class='topic4'>left</span> me alone because you <span class='topic2'>cared</span> for me <br/> 
And I could see you <span class='topic37'>comin</span> <span class='topic41'>home</span> after <span class='topic4'>work</span> <span class='topic4'>late</span> <br/> <span class='topic45'>
You're</span> in the <span class='topic4'>kitchen</span> tryin to fix us a hot plate <br/> 
Ya just <span class='topic37'>workin</span> with the scraps you was given <br/> 
And <span class='topic4'>mama</span> made miracles every Thanksgivin <br/> 
But now the <span class='topic4'>road</span> got rough, <span class='topic45'>you're</span> alone <br/> <span class='topic45'>
You're</span> tryin to <span class='topic4'>raise</span> two bad <span class='topic4'>kids</span> on your own <br/> 
And there's no way I can pay you back <br/> 
But my plan is to <span class='topic41'>show</span> you that I <span class='topic45'>understand</span> <br/> 
You are appreciated <br/>

Verse Three: 2Pac <br/> 
 <br/> 
Pour out some <span class='topic39'>liquor</span> and I reminsce, cause through the <span class='topic4'>drama</span> <br/> 
I can always depend on my <span class='topic4'>mama</span> <br/> 
And when it seems that I'm hopeless <br/> 
You say the <span class='topic41'>words</span> that can get me back in focus <br/> 
When I was <span class='topic25'>sick</span> as a little kid <br/> 
To keep me <span class='topic8'>happy</span> there's no <span class='topic6'>limit</span> to the <span class='topic45'>things</span> you did <br/> 
And all my childhood <span class='topic4'>memories</span> <br/> 
Are full of all the <span class='topic25'>sweet</span> <span class='topic45'>things</span> you did for me <br/> 
And even though I act craaazy <br/> 
I gotta thank the <span class='topic4'>Lord</span> that you made me <br/> 
There are no <span class='topic41'>words</span> that can <span class='topic23'>express</span> how I <span class='topic8'>feel</span> <br/> 
You never kept a secret, always stayed <span class='topic39'>real</span> <br/> 
And I appreciate, how you raised me <br/> 
And all the extra <span class='topic8'>love</span> that you <span class='topic4'>gave</span> me <br/> 
I wish I could take the <span class='topic2'>pain</span> away <br/> 
If you can make it through the <span class='topic23'>night</span> there's a brighter day <br/> 
Everything will be <span class='topic45'>alright</span> if ya <span class='topic8'>hold</span> on <br/> 
It's a <span class='topic2'>struggle</span> <span class='topic4'>everyday,</span> gotta roll on <br/> 
And there's no way I can pay you back <br/> 
But my plan is to <span class='topic6'>show</span> you that I <span class='topic4'>understand</span> <br/> 
You are appreciated <br/> 
 <br/> 
Chorus <br/> 
 <br/> <span class='topic25'>
Sweet</span> <span class='topic4'>lady</span> <br/> 
        And <span class='topic4'>dear</span> <span class='topic4'>mama</span> <br/> 
 <br/> 
        <span class='topic4'>Dear</span> <span class='topic4'>mama</span> <br/> <span class='topic4'>
